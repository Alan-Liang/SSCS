# SSCS
Simple and Slow Chatting Service

A chatting service by Alan?Liang using node.js(nw.js on nwjs branch)

## Usage
1. Edit `rc` in `server.js` to your room code;
2. Use `node server.js` or `node` then `.load server.js`;
3. Type `localhost:8080` in your browser's address bar, type in your name and a valid room code, then enjoy chatting!

## Advanced
You can specify your listening ip and port by editing variant `ipaddress` and `port`, as they are `127.0.0.1` and `8080` by default.

You can also change the updating time by editing `chat.html`'s last part of `setInterval`(in miliseconds and 1000 by default).
